This tutorial is for someone that would like to require signing of transactions from multiple devices. In this workflow, we will be using a laptop, desktop, and mobile phone to create a 3 of 3 wallet. You can also use this workflow as a template to easily create a 2 of 2 wallet where you're required to sign a transaction from your desktop and your phone.

4. Assign the keys you selected to the wallet by clicking the "Assign To Wallet" button. You should see the keys listed on the right side now under "Key Configuration"

<img src = assignToWallet.png
    alt = "Assign to Wallet button (Screenshot)"
    style = "float: left"/>

<img src = assignedKeys.png 
    alt = "Assigned keys (Screenshot)"
    style = "float: center"/>


5. Add the number of signatures (keys) required to sign/send a transaction. You can only require as many keys that you have associated with the wallet. Each key required is a signer for the transaction.

    alt = "Required signature (Screenshot)"/>

6. Proceed to the next screen by clicking "Next: Review Wallet" and confirm the details of the wallet. Finalize your wallet by clicking the "Create Wallet" button.

    alt = "Confirm wallet details (Screenshot)"/>

{{< notice warning >}}
  You will be prompted to backup your wallet by creating a BSMS (Bitcoin Secure Multisig Setup) File. This is highly recommended for a multisignature wallet. In order to recreate a multisig wallet you are required to have either the BSMS file *OR* all the keys that are associated with it. Put simply, if you create a 2 of 3 and lose one of the keys, you would need all 3 keys to recreate the wallet in order to recreate the wallet and sign a transaction. If you do not have a backup or a working wallet, you risk losing access to your funds forever.

{{< notice note >}}
This backup file strictly contains information about the wallet. This means access to this file could be used to <u>see</u> the wallet's funds but not to <u>spend</u> from the wallet.
