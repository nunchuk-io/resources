{{< faq "What happens to my bitcoin if Nunchuk goes down or ceases to exist?" >}}
Nunchuk is a self-custodial wallet developed using open standards ([seed phrase backup is defined in BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki), while [wallet configuration backup is defined in BIP129](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0129.mediawiki)). That means you always have complete control over your funds. As long as you maintain proper backups, you can recover your Nunchuk wallets elsewhere.
